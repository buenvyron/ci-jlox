# Overview

This is my own implementation of the Lox language using Java. 

The project is still in early phases, so changes will be applied over the course of me learning about the book, [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

## Scanner
The scanner is almost the same form the one presented at the book. With some minimal changes to error messages.
